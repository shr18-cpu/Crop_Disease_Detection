AI-Powered Crop Monitoring and Advisory System
Project Overview
The prototype is an AI-powered crop monitoring and advisory system developed to support farmers in early disease detection and crop management. Through a user-friendly web interface, farmers can upload images of crop leaves, and the system automatically identifies whether the plant is healthy or affected by common diseases. Based on the classification results, the system delivers localized, low-cost advisory recommendations, including remedies, prevention strategies, and integration with weather data to guide timely interventions. This approach demonstrates the potential of affordable AI technologies in agriculture, providing actionable insights without the need for expensive drones or IoT-based tools. The system is designed to be scalable, multilingual, and accessible, helping farmers reduce crop losses and improve yield.

Technologies & Tools
Development Environment
•	Google Colab: The notebook runs in Google Colab, providing
o	Free GPU/TPU runtime for accelerated training.
o	Seamless Google Drive integration for dataset storage.
o	Built-in utilities for file upload and download (from google.colab import files).
Programming Language
•	Python 3.x: The primary language for developing and training the deep learning model.
Core Libraries
•	TensorFlow / Keras:
o	Used to implement deep learning models and workflows.
o	VGG16 pre-trained CNN model (trained on ImageNet) imported from tensorflow.keras.applications.
o	Layers such as Sequential, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, Input are used to build custom classification heads.
o	Adam optimizer applied for model training.
o	image_dataset_from_directory employed to load image data directly into TensorFlow datasets.
o	Transfer learning and fine-tuning applied to leverage pre-trained features for improved performance.
•	Matplotlib: Used for plotting training and validation metrics, enabling visualization of model performance over epochs.

Deep Learning Techniques
1.	Transfer Learning:
o	Uses VGG16 base model without top layers to extract meaningful features.
2.	Data Augmentation:
o	Techniques such as RandomFlip, RandomRotation, and RandomZoom applied to improve generalization.
3.	Fine-Tuning:
o	Initially, the VGG16 base is frozen to train only custom layers.
o	Later, selective unfreezing and retraining with a smaller learning rate (1e-5) improves accuracy.
4.	Classification Task:
o	Multi-class classification with softmax activation in the output layer.
o	Loss function: categorical_crossentropy.

Data Handling
•	Datasets are stored in Google Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset_Crops).
•	Dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.
•	Preprocessing: preprocess_input (VGG16-specific normalization) applied to all images.
•	Performance Optimization:
o	.cache() and .prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE) used for efficient data loading.

Model Saving and Export
•	The trained model is saved in Keras format:
model.save('trained_Crop_disease_model.keras')
•	The model can be downloaded for deployment or further use:
from google.colab import files
files.download("trained_Crop_disease_model.keras")
